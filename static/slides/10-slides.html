**Today:** Introduction to (simple) time varying exposures

**Thursday:** Exercise and discussion

# Why do exposures vary over time?

Interventions are often static:

- Ban chemical X
- Treat condition Y using drug Z for the duration of illness

But when estimating the effects of these (often hypothetical) interventions using observational data, we often see that exposure varies over time.

For example:

- Exposure to chemical X changes when people move or get a new job
- People discontinue drug Z due to side effects

# A simple scenario

This week, we will begin to think about time varying exposures in a simple setting:

&gt; You are studying a possible treatment for disease X, which currently has no available treatments. 

&gt; You perform a trial in which you recruit people with disease X and randomize them to no treatment or treatment with Drug A for the duration of illness. 

&gt;Some people who you randomize to Drug A discontinue treatment during the year. 

&gt;You want to compare the probability of recovery by 1 year. 

&gt; Assume no loss to follow-up and no deaths or other competing events occured during the course of the study.

# Example DAG

# Choosing a parameter

What do we want to estimate?

**Choices**

The &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;"intent-to-treat" &lt;/span&gt; parameter: What would the probability of recovery have been if I had assigned everyone to take drug A vs if I had assigned everyone to no treatment?

- We estimate risk in the treatment arm without regard to treatment discontinuation

--

The &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;"per protocol" &lt;/span&gt; parameter: What would the probability of recovery have been if I had assigned everyone to take drug A and they had taken it throughout follow-up vs if I had assigned everyone to no treatment?

- We perform a second "intervention" to prevent treatment discontinuation

--

.footnote[[*] "Intent-to-treat" and "per protocol" are just words. Do not expect everyone who uses these words to refer to the same parameters. If the parameter of interest is unclear, ask!]

# Statistical analyses

We will discuss how to conduct analyses to estimate the "intent-to-treat" and "per protocol" parameters.

1. How are the data organized? 
2. What estimators are used?

# "Intent-to-treat" analysis

Why can we use crude comparisons of unweighted risk functions in this example?





---

# "Per protocol" analysis


Challenge: We want to know what would have happened had everyone in the treatment arm remained on treatment throughout follow-up, **but some participants discontinued treatment**.  

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Solution: Censor people when they stop following the "protocol" (i.e., at treatment discontinuation).  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Account for this _informative censoring_ using IPW.

# Data setup

**Step 1**: Reorganize data to capture time-updated covariates, if necessary

&lt;img src="img/10/expand.png" width="70%" /&gt;

---

# Data setup

**Step 2**: Censor at treatment discontinuation


&lt;img src="img/10/censor.png" width="70%" /&gt;

---

# "Per protocol" analysis with IPW

**Step 3**: Use IPW to account for informative censoring induced in the previous step.

--

**Arm 1: No treatment**. Limit dataset to those randomized to no treatment. No discontinuation, so everyone has a weight of 1 for entire period.

**Arm 2: Continuous treatment**. Limit dataset to those randomized to treatment, censor at treatment discontinuation, and apply IPCW.

--

Let `\(T_D\)` represent the time of treatment Discontinuation.

`$$\pi_D=\frac{P(T_D&gt;t|A_0)}{P(T_D&gt;t|Z_t, A_0)}$$`

--

Let `\(D(t)\)` be an indicator of treatment discontinuation at time `\(t\)`

`$$\pi_D= \prod_{out=1}^{\lceil t \rceil }\frac{1-P(D_{out}=1|D_{in}=0, A_0)}{1-P(D_{out}=1|\bar{D}_{in}=0, Z_{in}, A_0)}$$`
--

We can estimate `\(P(D_{out}=1|D_{in}=0, Z_{in{}}, A_0)\)` using pooled logistic regression.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We would need to account for confounding of both `\(A_0\)` and `\(A_t\)`.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Solution: Set `\(\pi(t) = \pi_A \times \pi_D(t)\)`

---


# Extend to settings with baseline confounding

**Step 1:** Fit time-fixed inverse probability of treatment weight.

`$$\pi_A =\frac{P(A_0=a)}{P(A_0=a|Z_0)}$$`
**Step 2:** Fit time-varying inverse probability of treatment discontinuation

`$$\pi_D =\frac{P(T_D&gt;t|A_0)}{P(T_D&gt;t|A_0, Z_0, \bar{Z}_t)}$$`

**Step 3:** Apply `\(\pi(t)\)` to KM estimators to obtain risk estimates or Cox model to obtain HR

# Example: Infant flu shots





&gt; Infants require 2 doses of the flu shot, 1 month apart.

&gt; Consider a hypothetical example in which 2 "brands" of flu shot are available. You want to compare the risk of flu over 1 year if all infants received shot A vs if all infants received shot B.

&gt; When the first dose is given, parents receive a notice to return for the second shot.


.center[
&lt;img src="img/10/ex2dag.png" width="40%" /&gt;
]

---

# Example: outline

We will estimate the 

- "Intent to treat" (ITT) parameter: What if all infants were given a first dose of flu shot A vs what if all infants received a first dose of flu shot B?

- "Per protocol" (PP) parameter: What if all infants were given both doses of flu shot A vs what if all infants received both doses of flu shot B?


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We will estimate risk functions under each plan and compute an HR each analysis above (ITT and PP).

---

# Example: data



**Shot A**: 4971 participants elected shot A. 

- 41% had covariate `\(Z_0=1\)` at baseline 

- of infants receiving shot A, 25% had noticeable side effects of the first dose 

- 65% followed-up with a second dose


**Shot B**: 5029 participants elected shot B. 
- 58% had covariate `\(Z_0=1\)` at baseline

- of infants receiving shot B, 57% had noticeable side effects of the first dose

- 55% followed-up with a second dose.

# Discussion points

"Protocols" can be as simple or as complex as you wish

- In the reading, some types of treatment switch were not counted as protocol deviations. Why?

--


Just because you _can_ run a per protocol analysis doesn't mean you want to.

- When might the ITT be useful?


--

The reading mentioned this idea of emulating a randomized trial using observational data. Why might this be useful?
