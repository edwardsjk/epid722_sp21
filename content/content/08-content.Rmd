## Notes

This week's reading is an excellent introduction to IPW for survival functions. As you read, be sure you can answer the following questions:

- Why was the paper written? What problem was it trying to solve?
- What is the point of the first paragraph on page 46?
- Why are non-parametric standardization and IPW infeasible in the presence of multiple or continuous covariates?
- On page 46, what do they mean by “prior logistic regression models?”
- Why use stabilized vs unstabilized weights? What is the difference?
- What is the “pseudopopulation?”
- What does the “+” mean in Table 1?
- What is the point of Table 2?
