## Notes

As a self check, reflect on how what you learned helps answer the following questions:

1.	What is immortal person time?
2.	What is risk? What is survival?
3.	What is the hazard?
4.	What is a nonparametric estimator and how does it differ from a parametric estimator?
5.	How does the Kaplan-Meier account for late entry and censoring?
6.	What are the pros and cons of allowing late entry? 
7.	How can we assess the possible effects of informative drop out?
8.	What is a line diagram and how is it drawn?
9.	Fill in a table like Table 2 in the Cole and Hudgens paper in AIDS given sample data
10.	When is censoring informative?
11.	What do we assume about censoring when using the Kaplan-Meier?
12.	What is the difference between a parameter and an estimator?
