<h2>Course objectives</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Build competence in asking and answering important public health questions</li>
<li>Understand and appreciate time in epidemiologic studies</li>
<li>Address threats to accuracy in epidemiologic studies</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="course-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Course structure</h2>
<p>Each topic will be covered during 2 course periods. The first (typically Tuesdays, but occasionally Thursdays due to university “wellness days”) will be reserved for short, modular lectures, initiated with small group discussions and closed with class-wide discussion. During the second course period on each topic, students will discuss exercises in small groups and we will again close with class-wide discussion of lingering questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="readings" class="section level2">
<h2>Readings</h2>
<p>One reading will be assigned each week. Students are expected to read thoroughly and submit one question about the week’s reading to the course website by the day prior to the first course meeting for that topic at 9am (on a typical week, this will be Monday at 9am). Please reference the page, column, and line number that motivated your question.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercises" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>Each week, students will complete an exercise outside of class to be discussed during the second course meeting on each topic. Students are expected to submit written answers to the exercise questions prior to that course meeting (typically Thursdays). Collaboration on the exercises is encouraged, but all students must submit individual answers to the exercise questions. Exercises will be graded for completion.</p>
</div>
<div id="midterm-exam" class="section level2">
<h2>Midterm Exam</h2>
<p>The course will contain one mid-term exam. The exam is designed to require between 1 and 3 hours to complete, however, students will be given 4 days to complete the exam to allow for nonstandard schedules during the pandemic. The exam will be “open book,” but no collaboration will be allowed.</p>
<p><em>Important</em>: Note that this year’s exam will be distributed on <strong>March 19th at 5pm and will be due on March 23rd at 5pm</strong>. Please let the instructors know immediately if you have a conflict with these dates.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p>Students will work in groups of 3 students to write a letter to the editor on any methodological topic in epidemiology in response to a published paper. Letters should be formatted for the American Journal of Epidemiology (see <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/pages/Instructions_To_Authors">AJE Author Instructions</a>) and will be due on the last day of class (May 4th) at 5pm. An example of a successful letter to the editor from last year can be found <a href="https://academic-oup-com.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/aje/article/189/12/1637/5861136">here</a>. Note that, while we are asking you to format your letter according to the AJE guidelines, you may write your letter in response to any published paper.</p>
<p>Students should submit the names of their group members and proposed topic by 5pm on Thursday, April 8th.</p>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level2">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>The final grade will be based on completion of the weekly exercises (30%), the midterm exam (40%), the final project (20%), and class participation (10%).</p>

<div id="this-year" class="section level2">
<h2>This year</h2>
<p>The past year has been tumultuous. The pandemic and political situation have added a great deal of stress to the beginning of 2021. In this course, we strive to create an atmosphere that encourages learning and exploration of ideas without compounding that stress. Please contact the instructors or TAs with any concerns. Above all, <strong>remember to be kind to yourself and others</strong> as we navigate the coming months.</p>
